"""
result is a list that stores the sequence of actions needed to reach the goal state, in case the planner finds a solution.

frontier is a queue data structure that stores the states that need to be expanded. It follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) rule, meaning that the first state that was added to the queue will be the first one to be explored.

visited is a set that stores all the states that have already been visited during the search process. If a state has already been visited, it will not be added to either the frontier or all_states again. This helps to prevent the algorithm from revisiting the same states multiple times and getting stuck in a loop
